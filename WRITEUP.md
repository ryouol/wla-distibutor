# Log Distributor Implementation Notes

## Core Implementation
- Used Go for high-performance concurrent processing
- Implemented weighted random distribution strategy
- Non-blocking queue-based architecture for high throughput
- Health check system for analyzer failure detection
- Docker Compose setup for multi-container testing

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Distribution Strategy**
   - Weighted random distribution ensures proportional routing
   - Non-blocking queues prevent backpressure
   - Worker pool handles concurrent packet processing

2. **Failure Handling**
   - Health checks detect analyzer failures
   - Auto-redistribution to remaining active analyzers
   - Retry mechanism for temporary failures
   - Graceful degradation under partial system failure

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Multi-threaded packet processing
   - Configurable queue sizes and worker counts
   - Minimal lock contention in hot paths
   - Efficient JSON serialization/deserialization

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests** (`make unit-test`)
   - Component isolation testing
   - Mock-based dependency testing
   - Edge case verification

2. **Load Testing** (`make load-test`)
   - High volume packet processing
   - System stability verification
   - Throughput measurement

3. **Chaos Testing** (`make chaos-test`)
   - Random analyzer failures
   - System recovery testing
   - Distribution rebalancing

## Future Improvements

1. **High Priority**
   - Persistent queuing for critical logs
   - TLS/Authentication for security
   - Prometheus metrics integration

2. **Nice to Have**
   - Dynamic weight adjustment
   - Log batching optimization
   - Content-aware distribution
   - Distributor clustering

## Implementation Notes
- Time Complexity: O(1) for distribution
- Space Complexity: O(n) where n is queue size
- Thread-safe operations using mutex locks
- Non-blocking distribution using channels
